# Welcome to the LPO & LIIS GitHub Organization

## About Us

This GitHub organization is a **private space** dedicated to the members of the **Laboratory of Intelligent Interactive Systems (LIIS)** and the **Laboratório de Pesquisa Operacional (LPO)** at **Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA)**. It serves as a collaborative environment for research and development in **software engineering, artificial intelligence, user experience, telecommunications, and applied computing**.

### Laboratory of Intelligent Interactive Systems (LIIS)
The **LIIS** is a research laboratory focused on **software engineering, user experience (UX), and artificial intelligence (AI)**. It is linked to the following academic programs at UFPA:
- **Postgraduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEE)**
- **Postgraduate Program in Anthropic Studies in the Amazon (PPGEAA)**
- **Faculty of Computer Engineering and Telecommunications (FCT)**

The laboratory operates with the support of **Inteceleri Tecnologia para Educação** and is located in the main building of the **Electrical, Computer, Telecommunications and Biomedical Engineering Laboratory (LEEC-Bio)**.

### Laboratório de Pesquisa Operacional (LPO)
The **LPO** focuses on research and development in **telecommunications and applied computing**, working in collaboration with **national and international partners from academia and industry**. It is primarily linked to the **Postgraduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEE)** at UFPA.

The lab’s main goals include:
- Conducting **research and development** in key areas of telecommunications and computing.
- Providing **education and training** through research-oriented learning.
- Engaging in **collaborative projects** with researchers and industry professionals.

Although its main focus is on postgraduate research, **LPO also involves undergraduate students** from the **Faculty of Computer Engineering and Telecommunications (FCT)** in its activities.
